# CLAUDE.md

Guidance for Claude Code when working in this repository.

## What this repo is

A Next.js (App Router) implementation of
[techtankto.com](https://www.techtankto.com/), Toronto's volunteer-run
tech community website. The redesign moves away from a flat "link-tree"
layout toward a conversion-oriented onboarding hub that funnels
visitors into specific roles — attendee, speaker, host, sponsor, or
volunteer.

Specs live in `prd/` (see `prd/PRD.md`); application code lives in
`app/`, with shared pieces in `components/`, `constants/`, and
`public/`. The initial UI scaffold was generated from the PRD via v0 —
[original prompt and generation](https://v0.app/chat/website-generation-from-prd-eLek8w4RJMh).

For developer-facing setup (scripts, directory tree, route map), see
[`README.md`](./README.md).

`prd/PRD.md` is the top-level document. Each file in `prd/pages/` fully
describes one route. The file tree under `prd/pages/` mirrors the final
URL structure.

## How the information architecture works

The redesign replaces a flat "link-tree" layout with a
**conversion-oriented onboarding hub**:

- `/` — social-proof-driven home (testimonials, event photos, logo cloud).
- `/about` — values manifesto built on four pillars: **Community,
  Innovation, Teamwork, Respect**.
- `/get-involved` — onboarding hub with four role sub-pages (Speaker,
  Host, Sponsor, Volunteer), each ending in an intake action (email us
  at `techtankto@gmail.com`).
- `/events` — embedded Luma calendar.
- `/press-kit` — standalone brand assets and fast facts for media.
- `/legal` — grouped compliance documents.

The `/get-involved` and `/legal` sections are designed for **Next.js
shared layouts** (sticky sub-nav, persistent CTA, consistent form/
document styling).

## Working conventions

### Editing specs

- Keep the per-page structure consistent: Purpose, Primary audience,
  Key messages, Content sections, CTAs, Functional requirements,
  Acceptance criteria.
- Internal links between PRD documents are relative (e.g.
  `pages/home.md` from `prd/PRD.md`; `../about.md` from a
  `prd/pages/legal/*.md` file).
- When the IA changes, update **both** `prd/PRD.md` §2 (Route map /
  shared layouts / navigation) **and** the affected per-page files.
  Keeping these in sync is the single most important maintenance task.
- Never introduce a URL in a page spec that isn't reflected in the
  Route map in `prd/PRD.md`.

### Tone in specs

- Concrete, not aspirational. If organizers haven't confirmed a number
  (attendance, tier, timing), flag it instead of inventing one.
- Conversion-oriented: every page spec must declare **one dominant
  CTA**, and `/get-involved/*` must end in an intake action (email us).
- Social proof first: testimonials, real event photography, and
  logo clouds are required patterns, not decoration.

### Adding a new page

1. Decide where it belongs in the IA. If it's a role, it goes under
   `/get-involved`; if it's legal, under `/legal`; if it's a resource,
   it's probably a sibling of `/press-kit`.
2. Create `prd/pages/<path>.md` following the existing section
   structure.
3. Add the route to the Route map table in `prd/PRD.md` §2.1.
4. Add a link to it in `prd/PRD.md` §4 (Page-Level Requirements Index).
5. Update the relevant nav (global header or shared layout sub-nav)
   description in `prd/PRD.md` §2.3.

### Removing or renaming a page

- Remove the file, its Route map row, its index entry, and any inbound
  links from other page specs. Use Grep to find references before
  deleting.

## Things to avoid

- Don't let the implementation drift from the PRD. When behaviour or
  IA changes, update both the relevant `prd/pages/*.md` spec and the
  matching code under `app/` in the same change.
- Don't add numbers, quotes, or tier details that organizers haven't
  confirmed. It's better to leave a "finalize with organizers" note
  than to publish fiction.
- Don't re-introduce the old flat structure (separate `/speak`,
  `/host`, `/mentors`, `/donate`, `/terms-conditions` pages) — those
  were intentionally rolled into `/get-involved/*` and `/legal/*`.
- Don't touch settings or hooks without being asked.

## Git workflow

- Feature work happens on the branch specified in the session brief
  (currently `claude/techtank-toronto-prd-kuQxt`).
- Create new commits rather than amending. Use HEREDOC commit messages.
- Never force-push or skip hooks without explicit permission.
- Do not open a pull request unless explicitly asked.
- Do not sign commits or PRs as Claude, and do not include
  `claude.ai/code` session links, `Co-Authored-By: Claude` trailers,
  or any other "Generated with Claude Code" markers in commit messages
  or PR bodies.
