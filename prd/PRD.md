## TechTank TO — Website Redesign

**Source of truth:** https://www.techtankto.com/
**Document date:** 2026-04-18
**Status:** Redesign — approved IA, pending visual design
**Stack target:** Next.js (App Router) with shared layouts

---

## 1. Product Overview

TechTank TO (TechTank) is a volunteer-run, Toronto-based **Canadian** tech
community founded in 2023. The redesign moves the site away from a flat "link-tree"
layout toward a **conversion-oriented onboarding hub** that turns curious
visitors into active contributors — attendees, speakers, hosts, sponsors,
and volunteers.

The site remains content-driven marketing: it does not own accounts or
ticketing. It funnels visitors to external platforms (Luma, Slack,
LinkedIn, GitHub, YouTube, Instagram) and captures intake via email to
`techtankto@gmail.com`.

### 1.1 Mission

Foster a supportive and inclusive environment where people of all skill
levels can explore, create, and thrive in technology.

### 1.2 Core pillars (brand/values)

- **Community** — belonging, safety, inclusivity
- **Innovation** — curiosity, learning in public, experimentation
- **Teamwork** — collaboration over competition
- **Respect** — enforced via the Code of Conduct

### 1.3 Audience

- Software developers at all career levels (junior to senior)
- Designers, PMs, tech-adjacent roles
- Experienced professionals open to mentoring or speaking
- Companies wanting to host, sponsor, or recruit
- Media, partners, and sponsors looking for brand assets

### 1.4 Event types

- **Tech talks** — Lightning talks, deep dives, and technical presentations
- **Socials** — Casual networking and community building
- **Sports** — Active events like volleyball and softball
- **Code Diversity** — Inclusive events for underrepresented groups in tech
- **Panels** — Multi-speaker discussions on industry topics
- **Workshops** — Hands-on learning sessions (planned)

Note: Most events are free, but some (workshops, special activities) may
have associated costs. Do not advertise all events as "free".

### 1.5 Product goals

1. Build social trust via **social proof** — testimonials, event
   photography, sponsor/host logo cloud.
2. Convert visitors into specific roles through a dedicated onboarding
   funnel (`/get-involved/*`).
3. Keep event discovery effortless (embedded Luma calendar).
4. Provide a professional, one-stop resource for press and sponsors.
5. Centralize legal / compliance docs cleanly.

### 1.5 Canadian context

TechTank TO is a **Canadian** tech community based in Toronto, Ontario.
All external links to sponsor/partner companies should use Canadian
variants where available (e.g., `.ca` domains, `/en-ca` paths). The
community serves the Greater Toronto Area tech ecosystem and operates
under Ontario/Canadian jurisdiction.

**Current sponsors and hosts:**
- 7shifts (Canadian HQ)
- Rakuten Canada
- Cohere (Canadian-founded)
- Vena Solutions (Canadian HQ)
- Points / Plusgrade (Canadian HQ)
- Intuit Canada
- Microsoft Canada
- Prema Coffee (Toronto local)

### 1.6 Success metrics

- Intake emails per role (speaker / host / sponsor / volunteer)
- RSVP click-throughs to Luma
- Press Kit downloads
- Scroll depth and CTA click-through rate on `/` and `/about`
- Returning visitors and newsletter / Slack joins

## 5. Design Direction

### 5.1 Visual tone

- **Professional and welcoming**, not corporate and not casual. The
  visual tone should be credible enough that a sponsor's marketing team
  feels comfortable associating their brand, while remaining open and
  approachable to a first-time attendee from any background. Confident
  use of whitespace and a clean type scale; avoid anything that reads
  as playful or youthful.
- Keep the aquatic motif (fish logo, "Tank" vocabulary) but treat it as a
  subtle mark rather than the dominant motif.
- Prefer **real event photography** over stock illustration.

### 5.2 Conversion orientation

Every page must have exactly **one dominant CTA** that moves the visitor
toward interacting (Join Slack / RSVP / Email us). Secondary
CTAs are fine; tertiary links belong in the footer.

### 5.3 Social proof patterns (required on `/` and relevant `/get-involved/*`)

- **Social feed over testimonials:** Embedded LinkedIn and Instagram posts
  from organizers showing real, organic community moments. No curated
  quotes—let the genuine reactions speak for themselves.
  - LinkedIn: https://www.linkedin.com/company/techtank-to/
  - Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/techtankto/
- Numeric facts: 40-100 attendees per event, 45+ events hosted (25+ main
  events + 20+ CodeDiversity events), monthly cadence since 2023
- Sponsor / host logo cloud
- Linked previews of recent Google Photos albums and Instagram posts
- YouTube links to recent talks

### 5.4 Accessibility

- WCAG 2.1 AA: color contrast, visible focus, alt text on all photos,
  semantic headings, keyboard-reachable forms, reduced-motion support.

### 5.5 Responsiveness

- Mobile-first. Break at 640 / 1024 / 1280. The sticky sub-nav on
  `/get-involved` must collapse into a single-line segmented control on
  mobile.

### 5.6 Event archive & recap pattern

`/events` and the home page treat each event as a recurring entry in
an ongoing series, not just a flat Luma embed. Every event record
carries:

- Event number and/or date badge (e.g. "Event 14 · April 2026")
- Title and one-line pitch
- Venue + time chips
- Tag chips (topic, track, "beginner-friendly", capacity note)
- Host / sponsor attribution (**Supported by** + logo)
- Status:
  - **Upcoming** — shows "Next Up" treatment and an **RSVP on Luma**
    CTA
  - **Past** — shows a **View Recap** CTA linking to the event's
    Google Photos album and YouTube recording
- A past-events timeline lives directly below the upcoming event,
  so visitors can scroll the full history as additional social proof.

For v1, a "recap" is a linked bundle (Google Photos URL + YouTube URL
+ host/sponsor thanks surfaced inline). A dedicated `/events/<slug>`
detail route is a v2 option only if organizers want editorial recaps
and is explicitly out of scope for the initial launch.

### 5.7 Recurring UI patterns

- **Overline kicker.** Every major section opens with a short,
  all-caps kicker (e.g. `WAYS TO GET INVOLVED`, `NEXT UP`, `RECENT
  EVENTS`, `LATEST HIGHLIGHTS`, `GET IN TOUCH`) above the headline.
  Establishes a clear scanning rhythm.
- **Role cards with checkmarks.** The four `/get-involved` role
  teasers share one shape on `/` and `/get-involved`: icon → overline
  → headline → one-paragraph pitch → three bulleted checkmarks of
  what the contributor gets. Reused verbatim so the four paths feel
  like siblings.
- **Supported-by strip.** A single-line host/sponsor acknowledgment
  ("Supported by <logos>") appears above the footer on `/` and
  `/events`, and on each past-event card. Distinct from, and
  complementary to, the logo cloud higher up the page.
- **Dual end-of-page CTA cards.** Long pages close with a two-up
  card block: one "stay in the loop" card (Luma / Slack) and one
  "collaborate with us" card (email / `/get-involved`). Used on `/`
  and `/events`.
- **Direct-email contact card.** `techtankto@gmail.com` appears as a
  prominent, copy-friendly contact card (not just a hyperlink) at the
  end of `/get-involved`, `/get-involved/*`, and `/press-kit`. One
  line of context explains what we respond to.

---

## 6. Functional Requirements

### 6.1 Must-have

- Next.js App Router with shared layouts for `/get-involved` and `/legal`.
- Global header + footer on every route.
- `/events` renders an embedded Luma calendar (or API-backed list),
  **and** a hand-curated "Next Up" + "Past Events" timeline driven by
  structured event content (see below).
- Events are modeled as structured content (MDX or JSON). Each record
  carries: date, venue, title, tags, host/sponsor attribution, status
  (`upcoming` | `past`), RSVP URL, Google Photos album URL, YouTube
  recording URL. Powers both `/events` and the home-page preview.
- Prominent intake action on each `/get-involved/*` page — a
  `mailto:techtankto@gmail.com` CTA with a role-specific subject line
  and a suggested-details scaffold (copy-to-clipboard friendly).
- Press Kit exposes a downloadable ZIP of logos + a brand-guidelines PDF.
- Social share / Open Graph metadata on every page.
- Privacy-respecting analytics (Plausible or equivalent).
- SEO: sitemap, robots.txt, canonical URLs, per-page metadata.

### 6.2 Should-have

- Event `schema.org/Event` structured data (when eventing server-side).
- Newsletter / Slack invite capture block in footer.
- Google Photos album preview cards (Home and event detail).
- Branded slide deck template (Google Slides / PPTX) linked from
  `/get-involved/speaker` and `/press-kit`.
- Speaker run-of-show and host checklist (linked PDFs).
- Per-event recap surface: Google Photos album + YouTube recording +
  host/sponsor acknowledgment, reached via "View Recap" from the
  past-events timeline.

### 6.3 Nice-to-have

- `.ics` calendar export for events.
- Embedded Instagram feed (light, cached, non-blocking).
- Embedded LinkedIn posts from the company page.
- Dark mode.
- i18n scaffold (EN default; FR optional).

---

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements

- **Performance:** LCP < 2.5s on 4G mobile; Core Web Vitals "Good".
- **SEO:** Per-page metadata, structured data, sitemap, clean slugs.
- **Reliability:** Static or ISR hosting with CDN (Vercel / Cloudflare).
- **Privacy:** No PII collected beyond intake emails sent to
  `techtankto@gmail.com`; cookie banner only if analytics or embeds
  require one.
- **Jurisdiction:** Governed by the laws of Ontario, Canada.
- **Security:** External links use `rel="noopener noreferrer"`; third-party
  embeds sandboxed where possible.

---

## 8. Content & Brand

- **Voice:** organic, welcoming, genuine—inspired by the warmth of events
  like the Code Diversity meetup. Professional yet approachable, never
  corporate or childish. Toronto-local, beginner-safe, confident.
- **Typography:** a strong, neutral display typeface (geometric or
  grotesque sans preferred — avoid decorative serifs or script faces);
  a legible humanist sans for body. The pairing should read as
  industry-conference-grade, not startup-blog or community-newsletter.
  Final pairing per visual design.
- **Color palette (refined from event posters):**
  - **Teal dark (primary):** deep navy-teal for headlines, buttons,
    and footer (`#1B4B5A`). This is the primary brand colour.
  - **Teal mid:** secondary text and headings (`#2A6B7C`).
  - **Seafoam:** light aqua for soft backgrounds and accents (`#A8D5D8`).
  - **Mint:** green accent for speaker circles and icons (`#5B9A8B`).
  - **Peach:** warm gradient tone (`#F5D4C1`).
  - **Coral (accent):** vibrant orange for CTAs and highlights (`#E87C4E`),
    inspired by CodeDiversity event branding.
  - **Blush:** soft pink accent (`#EABFBF`).
  - **Sand:** warm off-white background (`#F7EDE2`).
  - **Gradient:** seafoam → sand → peach (textured, organic feel matching
    event posters). Backgrounds use subtle grain texture overlay.
  - **Glassmorphism:** frosted-glass cards with `backdrop-blur`, rounded
    corners (`1.25rem+`), and soft shadows. Used for cards and overlays.
  - **Photo-forward:** event poster images are hero content; design
    prioritizes real photography over empty white space.
  - Do *not* introduce hot pink, true blue, or colours outside this
    family without explicit organizer sign-off.
- **Imagery:** real event photography first; diverse, candid, well-lit.

---

## 9. Event Support (Organizer Tooling)

Not user-facing pages, but assets produced and surfaced via `/press-kit`
and `/get-involved/speaker`:

- Branded Google Slides / Keynote / PPTX templates (speaker + title card)
- Host checklist PDF (AV, food, timing)
- Speaker run-of-show PDF (intro / talk / Q&A timing)
- Social post templates (LinkedIn, Instagram)
- Email templates for sponsor outreach

---

## 10. Out of Scope

- Member accounts / login
- Paid ticketing (RSVPs remain on Luma)
- Merchandise store
- Native mobile app
- On-site donation processing (individual donations de-prioritized;
  corporate support happens via `/get-involved/sponsor`)

---

## 11. Open Questions

- Do we keep a first-party blog, or continue relying on YouTube for
  long-form content?
- Should `/get-involved/volunteer` gate behind Slack membership, or stay
  open?
- Is individual donation still a funded path, or fully replaced by
  corporate sponsorship?
- Do we want a public organizers / team page (possibly under `/about`)?
- Newsletter platform of choice (Substack vs. Buttondown vs. nothing)?
