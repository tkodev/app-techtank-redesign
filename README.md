# TechTank TO — Website Redesign

A Next.js (App Router) implementation of [techtankto.com](https://www.techtankto.com/),
Toronto's volunteer-run tech community website. The redesign moves away from a
flat "link-tree" layout toward a conversion-oriented onboarding hub that funnels
visitors into specific roles — attendee, speaker, host, sponsor, or volunteer.

Specs live in [`prd/`](./prd/PRD.md); application code lives in [`app/`](./app).
The initial UI scaffold was generated from the PRD via v0 —
[original prompt and generation](https://v0.app/chat/website-generation-from-prd-eLek8w4RJMh).

## Stack

- [Next.js 16](https://nextjs.org/) (App Router, Turbopack)
- React 19 + TypeScript
- [Tailwind CSS 4](https://tailwindcss.com/)
- [Radix UI primitives](https://www.radix-ui.com/) (via `@radix-ui/react-slot`)
- [lucide-react](https://lucide.dev/) for icons
- Inter + Space Grotesk via `next/font`
- pnpm 10 for package management

## Getting started

Requirements: Node.js 20+ and [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) 10.

```bash
pnpm install
pnpm dev
```

Then open <http://localhost:3000>.

### Scripts

| Command | What it does |
|---|---|
| `pnpm dev` | Start the dev server with Turbopack |
| `pnpm build` | Production build |
| `pnpm start` | Serve the production build |
| `pnpm lint` | Run Next.js' linter |

## Project structure

The tree below doubles as a route map — each directory under `app/` is a
route, annotated with its purpose.

## Contributing

See [`CONTRIBUTORS.md`](./CONTRIBUTORS.md) for contribution guidelines.

1. Read [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md) and [`prd/PRD.md`](./prd/PRD.md) before making
   structural changes — they define the IA, brand, and content conventions.
2. When adding or renaming a route, update both the route table in
   `prd/PRD.md` §2.1 and the corresponding spec in `prd/pages/`.
3. Keep one dominant CTA per page. Role pages under `/get-involved/*` must end
   in an intake action (email us).
