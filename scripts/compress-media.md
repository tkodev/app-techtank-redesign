# Media Compression Script

This directory contains a script for batch compressing and optimizing video assets for the TechTank website.

## Purpose

The `compress-media.ps1` script processes all `.mp4` files found in the `public/media/instagram` directory. For each video, it:
1. Downscales the resolution (max 480px width) to drastically reduce file size without impacting the UI.
2. Generates a highly optimized **WebM (VP9)** version for modern browsers.
3. Re-encodes the original video into a heavily compressed **MP4 (H.264)** version to serve as a reliable fallback for iOS and older devices.

This dual-format approach ensures the fastest possible load times while maintaining device compatibility.

## Prerequisites

You must have [FFmpeg](https://ffmpeg.org/) installed and available in your system's PATH.

### Installation (Windows)

You can easily install FFmpeg using the Windows Package Manager (`winget`):

```powershell
winget install --exact --id Gyan.FFmpeg --accept-package-agreements
```

*Note: After installing, you may need to restart your terminal for the `ffmpeg` command to be recognized in your PATH.*

## Usage

To run the optimization script, open PowerShell from the root of the project and execute:

```powershell
.\scripts\compress-media.ps1
```

If you encounter execution policy errors, you can bypass them with:

```powershell
powershell.exe -ExecutionPolicy Bypass -File .\scripts\compress-media.ps1
```
